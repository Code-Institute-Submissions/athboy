## **<ins>UX</ins>**
The Athboy community information hub websites was conceived as a central location for information about Athboy could be hosted. Clubs & groups 
already have their own web and social media presence but the community hub would provide a central repository with easy to navigate pages and 
links connecting to all the individual resources. The site is aimed at both those local to Athboy who want to find information quickly and 
those researching Athboy as a potential destination either for a visit or to relocate to. 

### <ins>User_Stories</ins>

**As a parent;**
- I want to find what clubs and activities there are in the local area that my children might be interested in joining.

**As a resident;**
- I would like to know more about Athboy and what events are going on in the area.

**As a someone that is looking to move to Athboy;**
- What information can I find on Athboy like the history, what does the community offer, what clubs activities are there. Where is Athboy I will need to commute to my job.
As Someone still unsure, I have gone through the content in the Athboy site but I am unsure and have a question.

## **<ins>Features</ins>**
The following describes the features that have been implemented into the website with some notes on future enhancements.
### <ins>Existing_Features</ins>
- Header image, nav bar & footer;
- The site was design with a common elements that span all pages of the site to replicate the user experience across all pages.
Responsiveness;
- The nav bar was locked to the top of the page to ensure ease of navigation, this is most important on mobile to prevent the need to scroll to the top of the page for the links.
- As part of the development reactive hover elements were included on all nav links and social media links. When the user hovers over the element, the site responds.
- In addition on the nav bar it is always clear to the user where they are and what pages are available to them. 

### <ins>Features_Left_to_Implement</ins>
- In the current version of the site, there are no additional features to implement.
- More information is being sought from others local groups & related to upcoming events.

- A future enhancement, would be to improve the events section to integrate a calendar view. (currently no planed timeline for this)
