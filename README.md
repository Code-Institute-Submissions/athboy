## **<ins>UX</ins>**
The Athboy community information hub websites was conceived as a central location for information about Athboy could be hosted. Clubs & groups 
already have their own web and social media presence but the community hub would provide a central repository with easy to navigate pages and 
links connecting to all the individual resources. The site is aimed at both those local to Athboy who want to find information quickly and 
those researching Athboy as a potential destination either for a visit or to relocate to.
